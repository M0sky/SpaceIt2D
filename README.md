**SpaceIt2D** Space optimisation system in the packaging process.

## Description

Implementation of a space optimization platform during the packaging process, which helps operators to place packages in different packages according to their dimensions and different restrictions such as weight, limit of objects per box, weight distribution in different boxes, etc. In this way, the maximum possible space will be used in order to reduce costs.

## Objectives

The functional objectives of this final degree project are the following:

### 1. Establish rules for the maximum amount of objects per box, balancing efficiency and ease of handling.
### 2. Distribute the weight equitably between boxes to prevent imbalances and improve stability in transport.
### 3. Develop a user-friendly interface that provides operators with clear information and suggestions to facilitate the packaging process.
### 4. Adjust the packaging configuration in real time according to changes in dimensions or restrictions, continuously optimizing the available space.
